## Welcome to CSV as BeakerX Table Viewer

This prototype is a tool to view and interact with files from the CSV 
collections generated via the WIPP platform. 
A CSV collection is a collection of CSV files. 
You can select any CSV collection or type to filter the CSV collections 
of interest. You can also select various CSV files within a collection.
Clicking the combobox in the upper right will open the selected CSV file as a BeakerX table.
Here are a few of the helpful features offered by this tool.

* Heatmaps
* Data bars
* Color by unique values
* Sort
* Rearrange columns
* Save as a new file
* Filter values
