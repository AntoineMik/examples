# AICS Classic Segmentation notebooks 
The repository serves as a starting point to use the `polus-aics-classic-seg-plugin`. The notebooks in this repository enable the user to tune the workflow hyper parameters by testing the algorithm on multiple images. Following this the user can save the settings in a config file that can be provided as an input to the polus-aics-classic-seg-plugin.
